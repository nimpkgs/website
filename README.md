# nimpkgs

The [nimble.directory](https://nimble.directory) alternative no one asked for, that I felt like making anyways.
Check it out at [nimpkgs.org](https://nimpkgs.org).

## why though...

In it's [current form](nim-lang/packages) packages for `nim` are managed by a single JSON file.
A web UI is available at [nimble.directory](https://nimble.directory)([repo](https://github.com/FedericoCeratto/nim-package-directory)).
But, there are some outstanding [issues](https://github.com/FedericoCeratto/nim-package-directory/issues/53) that have affected even my own packages.

This site is client-only, powered by [karax](https://github.com/karaxnim/karax) and styled with [unocss](https://github.com/unocss/unocss).
This makes it trivial to deploy with Github Actions.
